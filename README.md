# spring-repl

A java.lang.instrument agent providing a clojure repl that is spring aware.
The intent is to allow any spring based service or app to be started with this agent
and provide useful clojurey things to java-based software. Even if you don't care about
spring, this agent can still be useful to create an nrepl server in an existing application without
modifying any code or dependencies of the application.

## Usage
Add this option to your java application's startup args:

```
-javaagent:/path/to/this/jar
```
Create the jar via:
```
lein uberjar
```

At startup, this agent will create an nrepl server on port 8000. You can then use any nrepl client to connect.
In addition to starting an nrepl server, the agent detects the creation of a Spring ApplicationContext, and maintains
a clojure var referring to it. This allows clojure code to access any beans in the application context.
For example
```
lein repl :connect localhost:8000
```

Execute the following to list spring-related functions available:
```
(dir spring-repl.context)
``` 

For convenience, you might want to require the namespace and give it a shorter alias:
```
(require '[spring-repl.context :as ctx])
```
In the future I will likely make this require automatic.

## TODO
The spring-specific functions provided are minimal at the moment. I will likely add more over time.
I have exclusively been using this agent as a vehicle for injecting clojure code into crufty legacy
java code for testing purposes. Specifically, I have used this to experiment with writing integration tests for 
java code which will never be refactored for testability due to resource constraints. Having a repl
which can access all java packages and spring beans in a full running application has been interesting and 
useful.
